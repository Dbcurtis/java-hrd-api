      <p><strong> Java code that enables an application to control a radio through Ham Radio Deluxe.</strong></p>
      <p>The RadioHRDTest.Java file illustrates how to use the code assuming that the HRD ipserver is started with the default port
          and on the computer specified by the HRDServerInfo properties.
          Some of the functions are not completely implemented.  Some will be implemented as I find out more about the functions supplied by HRD 5.0 TCP/IP Protocol.
          In particular, I have not been able to determine how to set the repeater offset or the CTCSS value.</p>
      <p>Most of the setxxx calls verify that the setting took...  As a result, there is some delay (caused by HRD needing to update its status after such a setting).
      In addition, no attempt has been made to track status of direct user manipulation of the radio.</p>
      <p>My hope is that others will find this simple to use and a convienient way to interface to many types of radios.  Thanks to Simon Brown for giving me some hints.</p>
