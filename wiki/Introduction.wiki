**Java API for Ham Radio Deluxe V5 TCP/IP interface.**
This allows a Java client to control a radio that is connected to HRD.
Thus, almost any radio can be controlled by the Java client.

This implementation only supports a single radio attached to HRD.

Thanks to Simon Brown for his assistance.

The initial (incomplete) documentation of the TCP/IP protocol can be found at:

I have only tested with a Yaesu FT-897D.
I have tested using both localhost and a remote host.
